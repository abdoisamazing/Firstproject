# First Project
Project Topic: 
Exploring the Relationship Between Life Expectancy, GDP per Capita, and Current Health Expenditure per Capita for 2020
So I decided to this project as my first project using python and sql and then visualizing using tableau. Fisrt things first, I got the data from world bank and i did manipulate and checked if anything was missing on sql, so the data preprocessing was fone all on sql. And I was trying to answer such questions:
How does life expectancy vary across countries with different income levels?
What is the relationship between GDP per capita and current health expenditure per capita?
How does the distribution of current health expenditure per capita differ between countries with low, medium, and high life expectancy?
What is the relationship between life expectancy and economic status within different world regions?
Can we predict life expectancy based on GDP per capita and current health expenditure per capita?


So I will add the link for my colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_-ekVIun6nrizjEkt6OX4bg6txhLEEAS?usp=sharing
as the plotly graphs are not showig at all.
