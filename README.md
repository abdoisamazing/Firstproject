Project Topic: Exploring the Relationship Between Life Expectancy, GDP per Capita, and Current Health Expenditure per Capita for 2020
So I decided to this project as my first project using python,sql,and tableau . I am originally a pharmacy graduate and interested in data analysis especially in healthcare so I asked gt and it gave me this interestting project and I know defietly there is alot analysis that could be done on that, but I would like from your Proffesional prespectives to tell me If I am going the right way.
The questions I answered so far are : 
How does life expectancy vary across countries with different income levels?
What is the relationship between GDP per capita and current health expenditure per capita?
How does the distribution of current health expenditure per capita differ between countries with low and high life expectancy?
